# Strategy Pattern

- **Purpose**
  - Defines a set of encapsulated algorithms that can be swapped to carry out a specific behavior.
- **Use When**
  - The only difference between many related classes is their behavior.
  - Multiple versions or variations of an algorithm are required.
  - The behavior of a class should be defined at runtime.
  - Conditional statements are complex and hard to maintain.
