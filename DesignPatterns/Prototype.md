# Prototype Pattern

### Introduction
- **Purpose**
  - Create objects based upon a template of **an existing objects through cloning.**
- **Use When**
  - Composition, creation, and representation of objects should be decoupled from a system
  - **Classes to be created are specified at runtime.**
  - **Objects or object structures are required that are identical or closely resemble other existing objects or object structures.**
  - **The initial creation of each object is an expensive operation.**
  - **When to avoid building a class hierarchy of factories that parallels the class hierarchy of products**
