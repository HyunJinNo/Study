              [Singleton](https://github.com/HyunJinNo/Study/blob/main/DesignPatterns/Singleton.md)
- **Structural**
  - Address problems of using OO constructs like inheritance to organize classes and objects
    - Class: [Adapter](https://github.com/HyunJinNo/Study/blob/main/DesignPatterns/Adapter.md)
    - Object: [Adapter](https://github.com/HyunJinNo/Study/blob/main/DesignPatterns/Adapter.md),
