### Introduction
- **Purpose**
  - Allow loose coupling by **encapsulaing the way** disparate sets of objects **interact and communicate** with each other.
- **Use When**
  - Communication between sets of objects is well defined and complex.
  - Too many relationships exist and common point of control or communication is needed.
