# Decorator Pattern

### Introduction
- **Purpose**
  - Allows for the **dynamic wrapping** of objects in order to **modify their existing responsibilities** and behaviors.
- **Use When**
  - Object responsibilities and behaviors should be dynamically modifiable.
  - Concrete implementions should be decoupled from responsibilities and behaviors.
  - Subclassing to achieve modification is impratical or impossible.
  - Specific functionality should not reside high in the object hierarchy.
  - A lot of little objects surrounding a concrete implementation is acceptable.
