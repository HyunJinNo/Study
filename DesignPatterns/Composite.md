### Introduction
- **Purpose**
  - Facilitates the creation of **object hierarchies** where each object can be treated independently or as a set of nested objects through the same interface.
- **Use When**
  - **Hierarchical** representations of objects are needed.
  - **Objects and compositions of objects** should be treated uniformly.
