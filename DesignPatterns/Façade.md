# Fa√ßade Pattern

### Introduction
- **Purpose**
  - Supplies a single interface to a set of interfaces within a system.
- **Use When**
  - A simple interface is needed to provide access to a complex system.
  - There are many dependencies between system implementations and clients.
  - Systems and subsystems should be layered.
- **Characteristics**
  - Provide **a unified interface** to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes a subsystem easier to use.
  - **Does not prevent sophisticated clients from accessing the underlying classes.**
  - **It doesn't add any functionality. It just simplifies interfaces.**
- **Benefits**
  - Hides the implementations of the subsystem from clients.
    - makes the subsystem easier to use
  - Promotes weak coupling between the subsystem and its clients
    - allows changing the classes comprising the subsystem without affecting the clients
